## Event clock

The project is a simple time interval counter.

After we materialized an algorithm, we want to find which steps are bottlenecks. The most common factor we want to analyze must be the running time. There are multiple parts we want to observe and each of them ran multiple times. We can use the tool to recored each accumulate time interval of various events.

### How to use

Clone the project and copy the only header file into your project. 

There is a simple demo which you can refer. The demo needs the header file, so you should copy the file manually.
